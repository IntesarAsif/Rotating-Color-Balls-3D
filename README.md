By using **openGL**, made a project that displays four **rotating balls** of different colors (red, green, blue, and white) at varying depths. </br> </br> </br>
The balls are created using **spherical coordinates** and they rotate around their own axes. The rotation and rendering of the balls are updated in each frame,
creating a **dynamic visual effect**. This program demonstrates the use of **3D transformations, depth testing, and shading** in computer graphics.
